## Statement on Inclusion and Diversity

Inclusion and diversity are vital to creating a supportive and equitable learning environment for all students. As a college community, we are committed to fostering an inclusive culture that recognizes, values, and respects the unique identities, perspectives, and experiences of all individuals.

We believe that a  diverse student body and inclusive classrooms lead to a more dynamic and enriching educational experience for all students. It is our expectation that every student, staff and faculty member will actively contribute to creating an inclusive environment by:

Challenging and addressing any biases, prejudices, or discrimination they may witness or experience
Actively listening to and valuing the perspectives of others
Being open to learning about different cultures, identities, and experiences
Supporting and advocating for the rights and needs of marginalized groups
Creating a safe space for all students to express themselves and share their perspectives
We also recognize that inclusion and diversity is a continuous journey and we are committed to ongoing education and training for all members of our community to ensure that we are able to meet the needs of all students and create an inclusive environment for all.

We encourage all students to get involved and participate in campus initiatives and events that promote inclusion and diversity. We also encourage students to share their experiences, perspectives, and ideas to help us continuously improve our efforts.

As a college community, we pledge to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for all students, where everyone feels valued, respected, and supported in their academic and personal growth.
